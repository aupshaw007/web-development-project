                <p>My name is Armond Upshaw. I am currently an IT major with a concentration in cybersecurity. This is my first year at KSU, and I previously attended Pensacola State College in Florida, where I obtained an Associate's degree in Business Administration.</p>
                <p>I am also a professional baseball player and have been playing professionally for the last nine years. My experience in sports has taught me the value of discipline, hard work, and teamwork.</p>
                <p>Outside of training for my baseball season and doing schoolwork, I enjoy traveling to different places and exploring various cultures. This passion for exploration drives my curiosity in technology as well.</p>
